#### The story behind this funny and slightly dirty jokes repository is that Trump’s neck was censored because it looked sexually suggestive. Then my friend joked that he was busy gooning to Trump’s neck. I reminded him to goon the next day. That gave me the inspiration to combine it with Duolingo and its reminders. So I made a clone with features like push notifications, the streak animation, and a shareable day-streak image on the 3rd day streak (index2.html).

#### Here is a list of words created by fusing multiple entities into new terms:
- Duolingo + Donald Trump = Duonaldtrump
- Duolingo + Goon = Duolingoon

#### This HTML file is uploaded every day for each day of the streak.
